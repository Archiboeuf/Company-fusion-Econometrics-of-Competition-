# Company fusion

Project realized as part of a course of *Econometrics of Competition* at ENSAE. Done in collaboration with 3 fellow students. (Report in French)

We had to simulate competition between two companies selling drinks in several cities and calculate prices at equilibrium. Then we estimated the utility function of consumers as we did not know how the data was simulated and determine under which conditions the competition authorithy would allow a fusion of the two companies.
